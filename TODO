Legend:
 - TODO
 + Work started, partially done
 X completed
 N invalid, nixed

*** Short Term:
X add GPL boilerplate to source-files.
X startup-script: launch simple-GUI and connect things
+ Documentation: update README,.. complete built-in documentation, doxygen comments
  update application name, ChangLog, License,..
- Fix broken Inglisch documentation (generated man-pages, built-in doc)
+ clean out remaining (unused) hardcoded setMIDIControllerFunction in ./b_overdrive/overmaker.c
- check assert() -> must quit (NDEBUG must not be defined!) -- convert assert -> exit 
- envAtkClkM* - key-click , multiply by samplerate
+ built-in documentation: annotate available config-options
X leslie: allow to bypass completely (horn speaker filter/emulation)
- leslie: get Coefficients from JoS
- leslie: check butterworth x-over filter

*** Mid-Term:
- Logo, web-design
- add presets for commonly used drawbar MIDI controllers
- separate src/midi.c -> harware I/O, internal API to tonegen, key-mapping
- collect sounds-samples
- update build system - waf, cmake or automake
- create a website to easily share .cfg files and presets
- One knob to /dial/ age of the organ (crackle, x-talk, bleeding,..)
   make background-copy of oscillators[] and list-elements (lep),
   allow to re-compile terminalMix and playMatrix on the fly
   and dynamically switch midi assignemts.
- simply access to commonly used settings.
- record convolution sample(s) and enable convolution-cabinet emulation by default.
- resample Impulse Response files on demand
- leslie: allow to toggle bypass via MIDI-CC ?
- setup options for LV2 plugins (pre-runtime static config)
- leslie LV2 variant: separate audio outputs for horn & drum
- include a LV2 plugin-host to setBfree jack-app
  make the main app use LV2 effect plugins
- write current config and program table to file (resume later)
  (Note: programs can't change but the referenced program-file may)
- JACK session support
- OSX LV2 pkg

*** Later:
- proper GUI
- VST/VSTi wrappers
- MIDI-learn -> dynamic controller mapping

*** Much Later:
- rewrite in FAUST.grame.fr :)
