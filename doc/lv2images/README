3D models and textures for the openGL LV2 GUI
---------------------------------------------

The GUI consists of a fixed background model and moveable objects.
Each of which is modelled as independent object in blender and then exported
as 3D openGL mesh in a C header file.

For doing so, the "Blender OpenGL / C header exporter" by Krzysztof Solek was used.
http://ksolek.fm.interia.pl/Blender/
see b_synth/ui_model.h for the result.

The textures were done with gimp which has a "save as.. C-header" feature.
see b_synth/btn_overdrive.c for an example.

See http://gareus.org/blog/setbfree_-_3d_opengl_lv2_audio_plugin
for screenshots of the current design in action.
